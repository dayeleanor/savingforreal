          How Competitive Insight Increased Affiliate Revenue by over 350% For A Leading
          Craft Supplies Company
        </h2>
        <p>
          See how Competitive Insight helped give one of the UK’s leading craft supply
          companies an increase in their affiliate revenue by over 350%, their sessions by
          over 350% and their total number of referral partners by a whopping 1200%
        </p>
        <p>
          As one of the leading craft supply company’s was preparing for rapid growth they
          required an intelligent solution for growing their previously neglected
          affiliate program. This is where Competitive Insight was brought in to conduct
          research, program management, promotion, relationship management and outreach.
        </p>
        <h3>Rapidly Expanding eCommerce Business With Increasing Stock Range</h3>
        <p>
          When this craft company were in the process of adding far higher ticket items to
          their range, outreach was desperately needed as their existing customer base was
          not the correct target market for machines and high-end art supplies.
          Competitive Insight was able to survey the entire influencer landscape to
          identify the best targets that would require the least amount of advertising
          fees for product placement and in many cases were able to gain referral links
          back to high-end supplies without products needing to be sent to the influencer.
          Competitive Insight was also able to gain link placements on videos with many
          millions of views without any need for advertising fees outside the initial
          referral payment rate.
        </p>
        <h3>Beyond Influencers & Affiliates: Brand Partner Discovery</h3>
        <p>
          Competitive Insight played a vital role in discovering up and coming creative
          talent in order for the craft company in question to expand their original line
          of products. As our agency had previous experience with working in highly
          creative industries, we have an eye for distinguishing which influencers can
          increase sales and which of those rare few can successfully inform a popular
          line of products. Our competitive research audit listed influencers and
          affiliates separated by fifteen major territories and included metrics on the
          following: name, dominant social channel, follower count, engagement level, key
          insights, contact details, and status as well as which brands they are currently
          working with. As we knew the commission structure of competing arts and craft
          retailers we were often able to offer new referral partners a better deal for
          choosing to promote the supplies of our client.
