        <h2>How We Increased Sign Ups By 297% For A Top B2B SAAS Startup</h2>
        <p>
          When an innovative technology Startup was approaching the task of how to grow
          their traffic exponentially, they chose to bring on Competitive Insight to
          manage content strategy, link building and digital PR alongside scaling
          sustainable content production.
        </p>
        <h3>Technology Leader Ever-Expanding Their Features, Solutions, Use Cases</h3>
        <p>
          As this SaaS platform worked to increase the use cases that their technology
          could be used to solve, alongside the addition of new software, improved UI and
          customer-requested features, targeted promotion and digital PR were vital to
          communicate that this bootstrapped startup had everything to give its users.
          Even in a space where 99% of their competitors are seed funded.
        </p>
        <p>
          Competitive Insight were able to easily keep up with competitor keyword growth
          whilst working with a fraction of the budget that Silicon Valley based
          competitors were spending on cloud technology podcasts and conference placements
          (which could easily be in upwards of $20,000 for promotional packages).
        </p>
        <h3>Niche Content Creation & Specialist Knowledge</h3>
        <p>
          Many B2B SaaS marketers are peddling a content strategy that is stuck all the
          way back in 2017, where you would often see lead generation content that was
          obviously written by a content marketer without much knowledge on the subject at
          hand
        </p>
        <p>
          This lack of technical insight is unlikely to win conversions from key
          decision-makers, engineers or CTOs as these marketers fail to realise that their
          keyword research process is being informed by high volume queries that are only
          asked by first-year computer science students.
        </p>
        <p>
          The growth of boutique technical content agencies such as IAmOnDemand, LeadPanda
          & DamnGravity is indicative of the knowledge gap between marketers of yesterday
          and the technical content strategists of tomorrow.
        </p>
        <h3>Results:</h3>
        <p>
          Competitive Insight increased the clientâ€™s organic traffic by 220% and their
          organic keywords for highly relevant terms by 380% by focusing on
          well-researched content creation, collaboration with complementary technology
          leaders & sustainable link building from carefully curated sources. The link
          partners we selected all had a sustainable track record of netting number 1-3
          placements for the sites that they had previously worked with.
        </p>
        <p>
          Platform sign-ups during this period also increased by 297% with increased
          interest being expressed by enterprise clients as a result of pivoting content
          creation away from beginner engineering subjects (which the competition often
          selected for their keyword targeting).
        </p>
        <p>
          Within the past six months alone impressions in Search Console have increased by
          an additional million and clicks have increased by another 25,000 with average
          position and CTR ever-improving for relevant terms.
